## Empathize: Understanding User Needs and Challenges

### Background Research
- **Industry Interviews**: Conduct structured interviews with directors, storyboard artists, modelers, animators, and visual effects technicians to understand the specific technical and creative bottlenecks they face in film and game production.
- **Field Observations**: Immerse in shooting locations and post-production studios to observe current workflows and identify potential pain points.
- **Case Studies**: Analyze successful domestic and international 3D animated films, such as "Ne Zha," to explore their success factors and challenges.

### User Pain Points
- **Resource Intensive**: Traditional 3D content creation is time-consuming and requires substantial computational resources.
- **High Technical Barriers**: Industry-standard software has a steep learning curve, limiting broad participation from creators.
- **Communication Gaps**: Information asymmetry between departments leads to inefficiencies in collaboration.

**Completed:** ✅

## Define: Identifying Problems and Setting Goals

### Core Issues
- How can AI technology reduce the technical complexity of 3D content creation, enhance productivity, and maintain high-quality artistic expression?
- What are the requirements for building a system that can rapidly respond to natural language instructions and generate realistic 3D models, scenes, and human motions?

### Project Objectives
- **Develop an AI-driven Platform**: Create an integrated 3D asset generation and editing platform that supports the entire content creation pipeline from concept to final output.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Make the platform accessible to non-professionals, enabling efficient and cost-effective 3D content creation.
- **Ensure Industry Standards**: Ensure that generated content meets the quality benchmarks set by top-tier studios and is suitable for real-world film and game production pipelines.

**Completed:** ✅

## Ideate: Generating Solutions

### Technical Approach
- **Multimodal Integration**: Combine text, images, and other input forms using deep learning algorithms to interpret user intent and translate it into specific 3D elements.
- **Physics Simulation**: Incorporate a physics engine to ensure that generated human motions are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible, enhancing the authenticity of interactions.
- **Modular Design**: Divide the system into independent yet interconnected modules (e.g., environmental modeling, texture optimization, human animation) for flexible functionality and scalability.

### Innovation Highlights
- **Natural Language-Driven**: Allow users to control complex 3D content generation through simple text descriptions.
- **Real-time Preview**: Provide instant feedback mechanisms, enabling users to adjust and refine designs in a virtual environment.
- **Cross-domain Applications**: Explore applications beyond film and gaming, such as education, medical training, and more.

**Completed:** ❌

## Prototype: Building Initial Models

### Milestone Achievements
- **Initial Feasibility Validation (3 Months)**:
  - Test diffusion models' ability to generate multi-view images and encode spatial information.
  - Evaluate existing tools and technologies to confirm their applicability to the project.
- **Initial Prototype Development (8 Months)**:
  - Develop foundational modules for animation, texture refinement, and interaction, forming an early-stage system that supports basic workflows.
  - Conduct internal reviews and testing, making adjustments based on feedback.
- **Comprehensive Integration and Testing (12 Months)**:
  - Fully integrate all modules to ensure seamless interaction between components.
  - Perform extensive internal testing, collect detailed user feedback, and address functional issues to enhance stability and usability.

**Completed:** ❌

## Test: Validation and Iteration

### Testing Plan
- **Internal Testing**: Invite team members to experience the complete 3D content generation process, documenting and analyzing any issues encountered.
- **External Pilots**: Select a few partners or potential clients for small-scale pilot applications, gathering real-world usage data and feedback.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Refine product performance, fix bugs, and add new features based on testing results to ensure the final version meets market needs.

### Outcome Demonstration
- **Short Film Demo**: Use the system to generate a complete 3D short film, showcasing its robust content generation capabilities.
- **Documentation**: Compile a detailed report of the project development process, including lessons learned and user guides, to support future promotion.

**Completed:** ❌
